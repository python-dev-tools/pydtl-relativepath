- **Convert Relative Paths to Absolute**: Easily convert relative paths to absolute paths based on the current working directory or the current file's directory.
- **PathLib Compatibility**: Seamlessly works with PathLib, allowing for modern path manipulations.
- **Customizable Path Construction**: Adjust path construction through parameters like `parent_dir_jump` to navigate through directory structures.
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear error messages for invalid inputs, such as incorrect `relative_type` values or `parent_dir_jump` configurations.

## üîß Installation

To install `pydtl-relativepath`, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install pydtl-relativepath
```

## üíª Usage Examples

### Convert Path Relative to Working Directory

To convert a path relative to the current working directory into an absolute path:

```python
from pydtl_relativepath import rel2abs, RelativePathType

path = rel2abs("README.md", relative_type=RelativePathType.RELATIVE_TO_WORKING_DIRECTORY)
print(path)  # Outputs the absolute path to README.md
```

### Convert Path Relative to Current File's Directory

To convert a path relative to the current file's directory:

```python
from pydtl_relativepath import rel2abs, RelativePathType

path = rel2abs("..", "README.md", relative_type=RelativePathType.RELATIVE_TO_CURRENT_FILE)
print(path)  # Outputs the absolute path to README.md located one directory up from the current file
```

### Using parent_dir_jump to Navigate Directories

To navigate up or down the directory structure while converting paths:

```python
from pydtl_relativepath import rel2abs, RelativePathType

# Navigate up one directory from the current file's location
path = rel2abs("README.md", relative_type=RelativePathType.RELATIVE_TO_CURRENT_FILE, parent_dir_jump=-1)
print(path)  # Outputs the absolute path to README.md located one directory up
```

### Handling Errors

The package is designed to raise informative errors for invalid inputs:

```python
from pydtl_relativepath import rel2abs, RelativePathType

try:
    path = rel2abs("README.md", relative_type="invalid_type")
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)  # Will print an error message regarding the invalid relative_type
```
